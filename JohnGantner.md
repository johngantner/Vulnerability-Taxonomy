# Vulnerability Taxonomy CWE Homework

## John Gantner

### The CWE I chose and description.
The CWE I'll be addressing is CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials. This vulnerability occurs when developers embed credentials such as usernames and passwords directly into code instead of using secure methods like variables. Hard-coded credentials are easily accessible to anyone who has access to the source code, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access. This poses a significant security risk and can lead to severe consequences such as data breaches and unauthorized system access if exploited.

### Personal experience with CWE
In my personal experience, I've encountered instances of CWE-798 while creating a mock Facebook application while at Sinclair. I had hard-coded the credentials of users' accounts within the source code. This introduced a great risk because if an attacker were to gain access to the source code, they would easily be able to log in to a user's Facebook account. I would've patched this issue by implementing a secure management system, where information like usernames and passwords were stored in a separate file with restricted access.

### CWE in top 10 KEV list
While CWE-978 isn't in the top 10 KEV list, it is still a significant security concern. Hard-coded credentials introduce a serious security flaw, allowing attackers to easily obtain sensitive information and compromise systems. Even though it may not be as prevalent as other vulnerabilities in the top 10 KEV list, CWE-798 remains a significant threat to the security of applications and should not be overlooked. Implementing secure credential management practices and regularly reviewing code for instances of hard-coded credentials are essential steps in reducing this risk and ensuring the overall security of 
software systems.

### My cpe
cpe:2.3:a:JohnGantner:zoozve:1.2.3

- cpe is the CPE specification.
- 2.3 is the version of the CPE used.
- a means this is an application.
- John Gantner is my name.
- zoozve is my product name.
- 1.2.3 us the version.

### CVE and related CPE that also fell prey to this weakness
CVE Identifier: CVE-2019-11510
Description: Pulse Connect Secure (PCS) VPN appliances were found to have hard-coded administrative credentials in plaintext within its configuration file. Attackers could exploit this to gain unauthorized access to the VPN and potentially compromise the entire VPN.
CPE: cpe:2.3:a:pulsesecure:pulse_connect_secure:*
a: Application
pulsesecure: Vendor
pulse_connect_secure: Product
*: All versions (since the vulnerability affected multiple versions)
