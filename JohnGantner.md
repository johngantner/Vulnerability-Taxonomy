The CWE I'll be addressing is CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials. This vulnerability occurs when developers embed credentials such as usernames and passwords directly into code instead of using secure
methods like variables. Hard-coded credentials are easily accessible to anyone who has access to the source code, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access. This poses a significant security
risk and can lead to severe consequences such as data breaches and unauthorized system access if exploited.

In my personal experience, I've encountered instances of CWE-798 while creating a mock Facebook application while at Sinclair. I had hard-coded the credentials of users' accounts within the source code. 
This introduced a great risk because if an attacker were to gain access to the source code, they would easily be able to log in to a user's Facebook account. I would've patched this issue by implementing a secure
management system, where information like usernames and passwords were stored in a separate file with restricted access.

While CWE-978 isn't in the top 10 KEV list, it is still a significant security concern. Hard-coded credentials introduce a serious security flaw, allowing attackers to easily obtain sensitive information 
and compromise systems. Even though it may not be as prevalent as other vulnerabilities in the top 10 KEV list, CWE-798 remains a significant threat to the security of applications and should not be overlooked. 
Implementing secure credential management practices and regularly reviewing code for instances of hard-coded credentials are essential steps in reducing this risk and ensuring the overall security of 
software systems.
