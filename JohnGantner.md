# Vulnerability Taxonomy CWE Homework

## John Gantner

### The CWE I chose and description
The CWE I chose is CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials. This vulnerability happens when developers embed credentials such as usernames and passwords directly into code instead of using secure methods like variables. Hard-coded credentials can be easily accessed by anyone who has access to the source code, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access. This creates a significant security risk and can lead to severe consequences like data breaches and unauthorized access if exploited.

### Personal experience with CWE
In my personal experience, I've encountered instances of CWE-798 while creating a mock Facebook application while at Sinclair. I had hard-coded the credentials of users' accounts within the source code. This introduced a great risk because if an attacker were to gain access to the source code, they would easily be able to log in to a user's Facebook account. I would've patched this issue by implementing a secure management system, where information like usernames and passwords were stored in a separate file with restricted access.

### CWE in top 10 KEV list
While CWE-978 isn't in the top 10 KEV list, it is still a significant security concern. Hard-coded credentials introduce a serious security flaw, allowing attackers to easily obtain sensitive information and compromise systems. Even though it may not be as prevalent as other vulnerabilities in the top 10 KEV list, CWE-798 is still a significant threat to the security of applications and should not be overlooked. Using secure credential management practices and regularly reviewing code for cases of hard-coded credentials are essential steps to reduce this risk and ensuring the overall security of software systems.
